Hi! I am Haotian Li, an applied math graduate student at [University of California, Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/). Currently, I am working with professor [Naoki
Saito](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~saito/) (my PhD advisor) on designing natural graph wavelet packets.

I am interested in many topics: (Graph) Signal Processing, Machine Learning (Deep Learning), Computer Vision, Imaging, and NLP, etc. *Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.*
