The course I took with Prof. Shiqian Ma at UC Davis. 

* [MAT 258A: Numerical Optimization](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/MAT258A.html)

It includes interesting topics like gradient descent, subgradient descent, proximal gradient descent, augmented Lagrangian method (ALM), ADMM, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), online optimization and common optimization softwares.
