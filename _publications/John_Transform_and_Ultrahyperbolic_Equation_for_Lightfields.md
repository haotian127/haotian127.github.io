excerpt: 'This paper explores possibilities for new uses of the Radon transform for imaging and analysis of lightfields. We show that the previously reported Dimansionality Gap can be derived from an ultrahyperbolic PDE, first proposed by F. John, which is satisfied by lightfields. Based on inverse John transform we demonstrate rigorous Focal Stack rendering and viewing from arbitrary angles. Based on Asgeirsson's theorems for the ultrahyperbolic PDE we derive new kernels for processing lightfields. Our kernels provide alternative methods for depth computation and other image processing in lightfields.'

Based on Asgeirsson's theorems for the ultrahyperbolic PDE we derive new kernels for processing lightfields.
