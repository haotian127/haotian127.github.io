This is my qualify exam talk, which is my first research talk! It demonstrates what is the problem of using graph Laplacian eigenvectors to design graph wavelets simply based on the ordering of corresponding eigenvalues. Moreover, it proposes a remedy strategy of this issue, which eventually leads to design natural graph wavelet packets in the future.
